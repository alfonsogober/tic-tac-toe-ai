## 🧮 Functional Programming Architecture

This project implements a **pure functional programming approach** using the Ramda library, inspired by patterns learned from my time building enterprise-scale applications at companies like **Peloton**, where functional programming principles were essential for building maintainable, testable, and scalable software systems.

### Core Functional Principles

#### **Pure Functions & Immutability**
All game logic functions are pure, returning new instances rather than mutating existing data:

```typescript
// Pure functional board operations
export const makeMove = (board: Board, index: number, player: Player): Board => {
  if (!isValidMove(board, index)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid move');
  }
  return R.update(index, player, board); // Returns new board, never mutates
};

// Functional composition for game state evaluation
export const evaluateGameState = (board: Board): GameResult => {
  const winner = checkWinner(board);
  if (winner) return { state: 'won', winner };
  if (isBoardFull(board)) return { state: 'draw', winner: null };
  return { state: 'playing', winner: null };
};
```

#### **Functional Composition with Ramda**
Strategic use of Ramda's functional utilities for elegant, declarative code:

```typescript
// Curried functions for flexible composition
export const getCell = R.curry((index: number, board: Board): Player => board[index]);
export const setCell = R.curry((index: number, player: Player, board: Board): Board => 
  R.update(index, player, board));

// Functional board analysis
export const isBoardFull = R.pipe(
  R.filter(isCellFilled),
  R.length,
  R.equals(BOARD_SIZE)
);

export const getAvailableMoves = (board: Board): number[] =>
  board
    .map((cell, index) => isCellEmpty(cell) ? index : null)
    .filter(R.complement(R.isNil)) as number[];
```

#### **Strategic AI with Functional Priority System**
The AI decision-making uses functional composition with strategic prioritization:

```typescript
// Strategic move priorities (center > corners > edges)
const getMovePriority = (move: number): number => {
  if (move === 4) return 3; // Center
  if ([0, 2, 6, 8].includes(move)) return 2; // Corners
  return 1; // Edges
};

// Functional approach to finding optimal moves
export const getBestMove = (board: Board, player: Player, opponent: Player): number => {
  const availableMoves = getAvailableMoves(board);
  
  const evaluateMove = (move: number) => ({
    move,
    score: minimax(makeMove(board, move, player), 0, false, -Infinity, Infinity, player, opponent),
    priority: getMovePriority(move)
  });

  const evaluatedMoves = R.map(evaluateMove, availableMoves);
  const maxScore = Math.max(...evaluatedMoves.map(m => m.score));
  
  // Among moves with best score, prefer higher strategic priority
  const bestMoves = evaluatedMoves.filter(m => m.score === maxScore);
  return bestMoves.reduce((best, current) => 
    current.priority > best.priority ? current : best
  ).move;
};
```

#### **Functional AI Strategy Configuration**
AI difficulty management through functional configuration objects:

```typescript
// Difficulty configuration with functional approach
const difficultyConfig = {
  easy: { 
    optimalChance: 0.3, 
    description: "Beginner-friendly AI that makes occasional mistakes" 
  },
  medium: { 
    optimalChance: 0.7, 
    description: "Balanced AI with strategic play" 
  },
  hard: { 
    optimalChance: 1.0, 
    description: "Unbeatable AI using perfect strategy" 
  }
};

// Functional utilities for AI decision making
const getDifficultyConfig = (difficulty: Difficulty) => difficultyConfig[difficulty];
const shouldUseOptimalMove = (difficulty: Difficulty): boolean => 
  Math.random() < getDifficultyConfig(difficulty).optimalChance;

// Functional composition for AI move selection
export const getAIMove = (board: Board, difficulty: Difficulty, aiSymbol: Player, playerSymbol: Player): number => {
  return shouldUseOptimalMove(difficulty)
    ? getBestMove(board, aiSymbol, playerSymbol)
    : getRandomMove(board);
};
```

### Benefits of Functional Architecture

**1. Predictability & Testing**
- Pure functions are deterministic and easy to test
- No side effects make debugging straightforward
- Each function can be tested in isolation

**2. Composability & Reusability**
- Functions compose naturally for complex operations
- Small, focused functions are highly reusable
- Easy to extend with new strategies or rules

**3. Maintainability**
- Immutable data prevents unexpected mutations
- Clear data flow through function pipelines
- Reduced cognitive overhead for developers

**4. Enterprise-Scale Reliability**
- Patterns proven in production environments at scale
- Functional approach reduces bugs and improves reliability
- Type safety combined with pure functions eliminates entire classes of errors

### Functional vs Imperative Comparison

```typescript
// ❌ Imperative approach (mutation-based)
function makeImperativeMove(board, index, player) {
  if (board[index] !== null) throw new Error('Invalid move');
  board[index] = player; // Mutates original board!
  return board;
}

// ✅ Functional approach (immutable)
export const makeMove = (board: Board, index: number, player: Player): Board => {
  if (!isValidMove(board, index)) throw new Error('Invalid move');
  return R.update(index, player, board); // Returns new board instance
};
```

This functional architecture, combined with enterprise patterns learned at companies like Peloton, ensures the codebase remains maintainable, testable, and scalable for teams of any size.

## 🤖 AI Implementation

### Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning

The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal performance:

```typescript
const minimax = (
  board: Board,
  depth: number,
  isMaximizing: boolean,
  alpha: number = -Infinity,
  beta: number = Infinity
): number => {
  // Terminal state evaluation
  const winner = checkWinner(board);
  if (winner === 'O') return 10 - depth;  // AI wins
  if (winner === 'X') return depth - 10;  // Player wins
  if (isBoardFull(board)) return 0;       // Draw
  
  // Recursive evaluation with pruning
  // ... algorithm implementation
};
```

### Difficulty Levels

- **Easy (30% optimal)**: AI occasionally makes suboptimal moves for beginners
- **Medium (70% optimal)**: Balanced gameplay with strategic mistakes
- **Hard (100% optimal)**: Unbeatable AI using perfect minimax decisions

## 🔄 Cross-Platform Implementation

### Shared Library Usage

```typescript
import { TicTacToeGame } from './src/lib';

// Same API across all platforms
const game = new TicTacToeGame({
  difficulty: 'medium',
  playerSymbol: 'X',
  aiSymbol: 'O'
});

// Make moves (identical on all platforms)
const result = game.makePlayerMove(0);
const aiResult = game.makeAIMove();
```

### Platform-Specific Differences

The implementations only differ in:
- **UI Components**: React Native components vs HTML elements
- **Styling**: styled-components vs CSS
- **Platform APIs**: Native haptics vs web vibration
